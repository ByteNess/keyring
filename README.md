Keyring provides a common interface to a range of secure credential storage services. Originally developed as part of [AWS Vault](https://github.com/byteness/aws-vault), a command line tool for securely managing AWS access from developer workstations.

Currently Keyring supports the following backends
 * [macOS Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac) (with TouchID support ðŸŽ‰)
 * [Windows Credential Manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager)
 * Secret Service ([Gnome Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring), [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5))
 * [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5)
 * [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
 * [Encrypted file (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
 * [KeyCtl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/keyctl)
 * [1Password Connect](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect/)
 * [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts)


## Usage

The short version of how to use keyring is shown below.

```go
ring, _ := keyring.Open(keyring.Config{
  ServiceName: "example",
})

_ = ring.Set(keyring.Item{
	Key: "foo",
	Data: []byte("secret-bar"),
})

i, _ := ring.Get("foo")

fmt.Printf("%s", i.Data)
```

To configure TouchId biometrics:

```go
keyring.Config.UseBiometrics = true
keyring.Config.TouchIDAccount = "cc.byteness.aws-vault.biometrics"
keyring.Config.TouchIDService = "aws-vault"
```

For more detail on the API please check [the keyring godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/byteness/keyring)


## Testing

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is used to create linux and windows test environments.

```bash
# Start vagrant
vagrant up

# Run go tests on all platforms
./bin/go-test
```
